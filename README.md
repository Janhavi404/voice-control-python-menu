This is a menu-driven OS program launcher in python: With speech assistance
Enabling users to use the most powerful technologies by just pressing a number: Hadoop, Docker, Linux everything in one menu!! 
To make technology reachable to the masses we must come up with ways in which the user has very little to no knowledge of the said technologies and is still able 
to use them as if they were at the tips of their fingers.
By making a python menu of multiple technologies including Docker, Hadoop and Linux which are some of the most powerful open-source technologies in the world today.
The technologies incorporated in this menu are:
AWS
Hadoop
DevOps
Docker
Webserver (making and deploying)
ML
Linux (LVM)
To take it up a notch, I have added speech recognition to the project. Now there is no need to even type anything, 
just talk to your system and tell it which number on the menu you need to see done, and there you have it, it really is that user friendly. 

To understand the application further, just read it on my technical blog:
